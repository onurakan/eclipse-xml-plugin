# eclipse-xml-plugin
This project is developed by me in order to support (speed up) development of inhouse developed xml files.
Project contains the following component codes:
1. Eclipse Plugins, which are developed using Eclipse PDE (https://www.eclipse.org/pde/)
2. Eclipse Plugin UpdateSite. This is used for installing this plugin.
3. Nodejs rest server which is used for gathering plugin usage statistics logs, error logging and alarm generation, plugin version checking and validating.
4. Mongodb
